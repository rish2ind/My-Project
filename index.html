              <p>India comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, and part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[120] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west and, later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.[120] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.</p>

Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain.[145] The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree.

                     Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[300] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[25] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[301] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[302] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[301] and by Buddhist philosophy.

                  India is the world's most populous democracy.[147] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[148] it has seven recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.[149] The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture,[150] and the BJP right-wing.[151][152][153] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[154] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the centre.[155]

In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years.[156] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[157]

India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India, which serves as the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which "majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law". Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union, or central, government and the states. The government abides by constitutional checks and balances. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[165] states in its preamble that India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.[166] India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states,[167] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.</p>

               According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2017 was nominally worth US$2.611 trillion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$9.459 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP.[15] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–12,[216] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[217] However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP.[218] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[219] since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system[220][221] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[222] India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.[223]

The 513.7-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2016.[207] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$70 billion in 2014, the largest in the world, contributed to its economy by 25 million Indians working in foreign countries.[224] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[186] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[186] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[220] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[225] In 2011, India was the world's tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter.[226] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and leather manufactures.[186] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[186] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[227] India was the second largest textile exporter after China in the world in the calendar year 2013.

               In India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda. Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts, such as kalarippayattu, musti yuddha, silambam, and marma adi, originated in India. Chess, commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga, is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters.[336][337] Pachisi, from which parcheesi derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.[338]

The improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country.[339] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[340][341] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton[342] (Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world), boxing,[343] and wrestling.[344] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.[345]

India was the host country for the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. The matches were held from 6 to 28 October in the cities of New Delhi, Kolkata, Kochi, Navi Mumbai, Guwahati and Margao.[346]

Field hockey in India is administered by Hockey India. The Indian national hockey team won the 1975 Hockey World Cup and have, as of 2016, taken eight gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals, making it the sport's most successful team in the Olympics.
